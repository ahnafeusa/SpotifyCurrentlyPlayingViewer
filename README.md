# SpotifyCurrentlyPlayingViewer

Inspired By : https://github.com/imdadahad/spotify-get-current-playing-track
- Implemented the showcasing of the currently playing song name, album art and artist names.
---
## What It Does

Displays the album art of the currently playing song and other details like the song and artist names on to the screen. If the user changes
the song on their spotify app (on any device) then the program automatically changes the output.

---
## How it works

Links the user's spotify account using an access token generated by the spotify API and then sends a get request with 
authentication and uses the json response to parse the the needed data. Pygame is then used to display this information.

---
## Requirements

`Pygame` 

```
pip install pygame
```


---

## Things I want to implement later

- Use OAuth for authentication to remove the need of generating an access token every hour (ish).
- An adaptive gradient background color based on the album art.
- Make a separate project that utilizes this to show the album art on a dedicated screen (inside a photoframe) using a
raspberry pi
